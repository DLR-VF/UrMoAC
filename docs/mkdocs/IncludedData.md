# Included Data

## Entrainment

* ***&lt;UrMoAC&gt;*/data/berlin_bike_entrainment.csv**: Defines the entrainment possibilities of bikes within the public transport in Berlin and Brandenburg (Berlin uses own carrier definitions)

## OSM Extraction Pattern

The extraction patterns define which OSM-structures shall be extracted, based on keys/values.
Their usage is documented at [Building the road network from OpenStreetMap data](./ImportScripts.md#using-openstreetmap-data-to-build-tables-of-certain-structures).

There are some sets of these files, as listed in the following.

The files are located in ***&lt;UrMoAC&gt;*/tools/osm/structure_defs**.
