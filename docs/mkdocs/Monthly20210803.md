# Monthly meeting 03.08.2022
## Recent changes
* Removed weighting sources when no source-aggregation is loaded (see [Monthly20210715](Monthly20210715.md))
* Added a configuration file support 
  * XML-configs
  * --config &lt;CONFIG&gt; loads parameter from XML-config
  * --save-config &lt;CONFIG&gt; saves given parameter into a config file
  * --save-template &lt;CONFIG&gt; saves an empty configuration file
  * works, tests exist
  * --> need support in including the optionslib.jar (Maven/direct)
* Added a custom mode for variable bike speeds 
  * enable using --mode custom
  * additional options:
    * --custom.vmax <DOUBLE>: sets max. velocity (resulting speed is min(allowed_road, vmax_mode))
    * --custom.custom.kkc-per-hour <DOUBLE>: sets kkc consumption per hour
    * --custom.custom.co2-per-km <DOUBLE>: sets CO2 emissions (in g) per km
    * --custom.custom.price-per-km <DOUBLE>: sets the price for using the mode per km
    * --custom.allowed <MODE>[;<MODE>]+: sets the roads to be used using those defined in the netwok (<MODE>: combination of {passenger, bicycle, foot})
    * not tested yet (needs a week or so)
    * Is this sufficient?

## Still open
### Reading from other formats
* Shapefiles: still untested
* SUMO: issue #1: they use String IDs, not numeric ones as us
* GPKG: cannot find an example for loading POIs from a file – how does this work in Python?
* Any other import formats?

## To decide
* Dead-ends always bidirectional **(yes)**
  * OSM has dead-ends that start at the network and end in a cul-de-sac
  * Starting at those just yields to the dead end
  * As a solution, I would allow to traverse them in the opposite direction as well (only if it’s a dead end, other unidirectional roads remain such)
* Prune double output to X places after the dot **(yes)**
* Change mode names (bicycle-->bike, passenger-->car) **(yes)**
