# Monthly meeting 15.07.2022
## Recent changes
### Reading from .csv-files
* Works, is tested (for sources/destinations, not yet for aggregation areas)
* Format: &lt;ID&gt;;&lt;GEOMETRY&gt;[;&lt;VAR&gt;]
  * &lt;GEOMETRY> is either
    * &lt;X&gt;;&lt;Y&gt; for a point or
    * &lt;X1&gt;;&lt;Y1&gt;;&lt;X2&gt;;&lt;Y2&gt;;…;&lt;Xn&gt;;&lt;Yn&gt; for an (unclosed) polygon
  * Coordinates (X/Y) must be given in meters
  * &lt;VAR&gt; is optional, determined by the number of columns (last odd)
* The header is ignored (all lines starting with ‘#’)
* Is that ok? (yes)

## To decide
### Reading type from extension
* Currently, you have to define inputs like **(yes)**
  * &ldquo;file;myfile.csv&rdquo; or &ldquo;csv;myfile.csv&rdquo; for csv-files
  * &ldquo;shp;myfile.shp&rdquo; for Shapefiles
  * &ldquo;db;jdbc:postgresql://server/schema;table;user;passwd&rdquo; for DBs
* I&apos;d propose to determine the format by extension, so
  * &ldquo;myfile.csv&rdquo; for csv-files
  * &ldquo;myfile.shp&rdquo; for Shapefiles
  * &ldquo;jdbc:postgresql://server/schema;table;user;passwd&rdquo; for DBs

### Aggregation and source weights
* When having aggregation areas, source weights (var) determine the influence of each source
* What if no aggregation area is given? 
  * A) Dismiss weights **(yes)**
  * B) Keep the weights, but then all the measures (tt, distance, …) are multiplied with the weight… Does not make sense at all…
