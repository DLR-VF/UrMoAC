## Scientific Use

### Which version should I use?

We always encourage you to use the last stable release, because you can easily refer to it as every stable release has an own DOI. Of course, the last release may contain bugs or lack features you need. At the end of your research, you should force us to include everything you used into an own release so you can refer to it.
