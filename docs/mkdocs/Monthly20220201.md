# Monthly meeting 01.02.2022
## Recent changes
* Solved dependency issues
  * Log4j was used by import jsi.SpatialIndex; have replaced it by spatial indices (currently STRtree) from import org.locationtech.jts.index.strtree;
* Regression since August 2021
  * No access to public transport (pt routes were not loaded)
  * Debugged pt output
  * And some other issues regarding pt-routing
  * Should be fixed now, but real (TextTest) tests are missing
  * pt edge splitting bug
* There may be more than one halt along an edge
  * There may be multiple halts at the same position at an edge
  * --> relatively cumbersome procedure for mapping
  * Implemented, but not yet covered by tests
  * BTW: GTFS may contain multiple stops with the same id. Warnings are now reported
* Added some tests --> coverage is at least improving

## Still open
### Reading type from extension
* Currently, you have to define inputs like
  * &ldquo;file;myfile.csv&rdquo; or &ldquo;csv;myfile.csv&rdquo; for csv-files
  * &ldquo;shp;myfile.shp&rdquo; for Shapefiles
  * &ldquo;db;jdbc:postgresql://server/schema;table;user;passwd&rdquo; for DBs
* I&apos;d propose to determine the format by extension, so
  * &ldquo;myfile.csv&rdquo; for csv-files
  * &ldquo;myfile.shp&rdquo; for Shapefiles
  * &ldquo;jdbc:postgresql://server/schema;table;user;passwd&rdquo; for DBs

## Wishes
* GTFS file importer (maybe from zips); Alain sends an example
* IntelliJ/Maven-issue with local library (or put optionslib on Maven)
* pt-output by segment
* json for configurations?
