# Boundary Issues

## Problem statement

The road network in UrMoAC is a directed graph with road segments as edges and intersections as nodes.

Road networks in UrMoAC are represented as line strings with the following attributes:

* ID
* starting node ID
* ending node ID
* allowed velocity
* length
* allowance for
    * foot
    * bike
    * car
* geometry (line string)


## Adding reversed Pedestrian Edges



## Optimisation

* join edges with same attributes at no-intersection nodes


## Missing

* turn restrictions
* lightning
* pavement
* type of bicycle road
* type of walking path
* green (trees esp.)
