Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

## Scientific Use

### Which version should I use?

We always encourage you to use the last stable release, because you can easily refer to it as every stable release has an own DOI. Of course, the last release may contain bugs or lack features you need. At the end of your research, you should force us to include everything you used into an own release so you can refer to it.


## Reported Errors

### Why do I get "Duplicate object '0' occured."?

You should check the ID column of your origins / destination for entries where the ID is not set. For any reasons, this is reported as 0 and counted as being duplicate.
