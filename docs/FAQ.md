Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

## Scientific Use

### Which version should I use?

We always encourage you to use the last stable release, because you can easily refer to it as every stable release has an own DOI. Of course, a release may contain bugs or lack features you need.


## Reported Errors

### Why do I get "Duplicate object '0' occurred."?

You should check the ID column of your origins / destination for entries where the ID is not set. For any reasons, this is reported as 0 and counted as being duplicate.
