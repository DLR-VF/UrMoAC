* We have chosen some links to external pages as we think they contain useful information. But the world is changing and so&apos;s the web. That&apos;s why we want to state that we are not responsible for the contents of the pages we link to. And, just to say it: mostly, the pages we link to were made by people better than us. We often WOULD NOT BE ABLE to be responsible for what&apos;s stated there.
* The software is provided &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo;. If you do not like it, do not complain. You may contact us anyway, we would be very happy about that.
* The software did not hurt us, yet, and even worked as expected, and there are even some (few) tests that prove it. Nonetheless, we cannot guarantee it will work as you expect.
