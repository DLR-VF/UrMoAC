# Creating a static documentation

Each version should include a matching documentation.

The documentation is built from the files located in ```docs``` using ```mkdocs```.

## Install mkdocs
Install mkdocs using

```pip install mkdocs```

Additionally, you need [material for mkdocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). Install material for mkdocs using

```pip install mkdocs-material```

## Building the documentation

To build the documentation open the command line and run 

```mkdocs build```

You will get a folder named ```site``` that contains the docs.
