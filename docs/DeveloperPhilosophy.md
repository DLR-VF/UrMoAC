Some notes:
1. **Use external libraries only if needed;**
   No matter whether the core or additional scripts are the matter: implement it by yourself if possible, do not rely on eternal libraries. They bloat the code.
2. **Speed matters, if you do not have enough memory, buy additional one;** We did computations that took week and used almost all RAM of our 128GB server. But we could add memory, we won&apos;t be capable to speed them up.
3. **Use tests;** Untested code does not exist.
4. **Document;** Undocumented features do not exist.
5. **Report;** You will be otherwise asked by users why things do not work.
6. **Fail fast;** If it does not work as expected, nail it. Maybe there&apos;s someone who knows how to do this. But let her/him know what has happened (see &lsquo;Report&rsquo;).
