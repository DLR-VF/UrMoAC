/**
 * @class MapResult
 * @brief The result of mapping an EdgeMappable onto the road network
 * 
 * The MapResult describes the mapping of a origin or destination (or a public transport halt)
 * to the road network. It consists of
 * - a reference to the mapped object
 * - a reference to the edge the object is mapped onto
 * - the distance of the object and the edge
 * - the position of the mapped object along the edge
 * - whether this MapResult represents the assignment to the opposite edge
 * 
 * The information about being assigned to the opposite edge is used to dismiss these entries from the according outputs.
